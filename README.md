# Incoming Requests

This basic server displays inbound HTTP requests to all users accessing the page via WebSockets.

Currently only supports POST requests to the route */post*.


## Usage

1. Install dependencies with *npm install*
2. Configure your port number in server.js
3. Start server with *npm run*
4. I recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or a similar tool to host your server on the interwebs
